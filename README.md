Hybrid-Anchor Rotation Detector for Oriented Object Detection

The repo is based on MMDetection and MMRotate

# Introduction
Oriented object detection in aerial images gains significant attention in computer vision and pattern recognition. Current state-of-the-art two-stage or one-stage methods commonly adopt Anchor-based strategies for region proposal generation using a redundant number of generated anchors for training, which is inefficient for the limited resources. At the same time, Anchor-free approaches are much faster but usually diminish a large number of training samples, excoriating the detection accuracy. In this paper, we present the Hybrid-Anchor Rotation Detector (HA-RDet), which aims to bridge the gap between Anchor-based and Anchor-free schemes for oriented object detection. In detail, we only use one preset anchor for each location in feature maps and implement further extra-oriented components that significantly boost the detection performance of HA-RDet and flexibly adapt to many well-designed oriented object detectors. Extensive experiments of HA-RDet and many other detectors are carried out on many well-known oriented datasets such as DOTA, DIOR-R and HRSC2016. Our HA-RDet achieves state-of-the-art results, competitively comparable with current Anchor-based methods, while the training and inference speed is asymptotically similar to Anchor-free competitors.
